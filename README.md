I'm Virek, a seasoned professional with over 12 years of experience across diverse domains. My expertise lies in Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft's suite of products, including SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, and Power BI. 
This portfolio showcases my proficiency in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics through various Power BI projects.**

**Professional Background**

1- **SSIS**

With a comprehensive background, I have successfully navigated the entire cycle of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages. My capabilities encompass developing, deploying, scheduling, troubleshooting, and monitoring data transfers and ETL processes across different servers.

2- **Power BI**

I've created interactive and informative Power BI reports, employing a range of visualizations such as Bar charts, Pie charts, Line Charts, Cards, and Slicers. My work involves extensive performance tuning and the implementation of bookmarks to enhance user experience.
Proficient in crafting complex DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas, I bring a deep understanding of data analysis to my Power BI projects.

3- **SQL**

My strong SQL skills and in-depth knowledge of SQL Server environments are evident in my work with Stored Procedures, Functions, Views, and Index optimization.

4- **SSRS**


In addition to Power BI, I specialize in designing enterprise-level reports using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). My SSRS work includes generating drill-down reports, parameterized reports, linked reports, sub-reports, matrix dynamics, and filters.
I have experience creating ad-hoc reports and data-driven subscription reports, showcasing versatility in meeting diverse reporting needs.

**Example**

**Existing Report Problem:**

The primary challenge with the existing data management system stemmed from the manual entry of information into the Excel file on a daily basis. Each month was assigned its dedicated tab within the file, and planned hours data were segregated into a separate Excel file.

The sheer volume of data became a bottleneck, requiring an extensive 4 to 6 hours daily for data refresh. Consequently, comparing employee data with the previous year posed a significant difficulty due to the cumbersome nature of the process.


**Revised Version:**

The solution to enhance the reporting system involved consolidating the report by merging related metrics into a unified visualization. This strategic approach aimed to present the end user with a more focused and relevant set of information at a glance. The implementation included robust data modelling in SQL to minimize processing at the report level, resulting in a considerable reduction in the overall data model's complexity.

The introduction of a dynamic date range filter allowed users to view data within their selected range, enhancing flexibility and customization. Additionally, combining the comparison of Actual vs. Planned and Actual vs. Target in a single view streamlined decision-making for management, enabling quick insights into business performance.

While not immediately visible, the solution brought about a significant performance improvement and heightened responsiveness of interactions within the report. Features such as date range filtering and slicing now operate more efficiently, contributing to an overall enhanced user experience.
